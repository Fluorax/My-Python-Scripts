# My-Python-Scripts
This Repo is a collection of various Python scripts I've been working on, while learning how to code. You are free to use them in any form for free.

# Seleniumff

Web Scraper built with Python which pushes scraped data through a Telegram bot. This scraper uses Selenium, which is not included in the standard
